# Klehrik

This GitHub profile is where I've uploaded all of my (significant) unfinished previous works that *are not* on my [itch.io page](https://klehrik.itch.io).

(I'm still in the process of doing this so this isn't all of them yet)

## Previous Works (Unfinished)

I am uploading these so they don't totally go to waste sitting on my drive.  
Feel free to adapt portions of code from these, but please do not continue any projects without permission since I may want to do that myself in the future.
